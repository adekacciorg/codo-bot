# codo-bot
An integration of Deepseek-r1 and vscode

This is an intiative to make a cursor like code editor - one that is open source. The project was made when the idea striked my little brain. more people the better

silly me. who would join an empty projet? lol. 

You can help if you are interested. I will try my best with or without a lot of people :)

after all, that's what kind of madmen programmers are :]

but the thing is, after a long time, there's not much to see on this project :-|
